            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Since the first time I booted up my Nintendo Entertainment System at the age of 3,
                I've been incredibly passionate about games. My life has been driven toward the
                career of game design; I want to create experiences that give people the same
                feelings of joy and wonder as I first experienced playing Super Mario Brothers.</p>

            <p>I am developing a skillset that combines the creativity of crafting gameplay with
                analytics and scripting languages. I am currently employed as a Game Designer for
                SGN, where I am focused on data-oriented systems design and content refinement
                for the game "Cookie Jam."</p>

            <p>My passion for design lies in creating and refining visceral, satisfying mechanics
                and gameplay, and a constant endeavor to improve myself and learn new things.</p>

                <h3>Cookie Jam</h3>
                <p>Since May 2015, I have been working for SGN on the game <i>Cookie Jam</i>. I created, tuned, and balanced over 150 levels that are currently live in the game. Once my skills in content creation were refined, I switched to tuning other designersâ€™ levels, and balancing live levels based on gathered analytics. I have trained new designers, wrote specifications for new game features, and learned an outstanding amount about game design philosophy and analytical game design for the casual / puzzle genre. </p>

            <h3>Lacuna Reaver</h3>
            <p><i>Lacuna Reaver</i> was my introduction to game development - it is a 2D top-down RPG in the style of <i>Final Fantasy</i> made by a large team of students from CSUSB. More information is available <a href="http://cse.csusb.edu/lr/">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Reignite</h3>
            <p><i>Reignite</i> is a story-driven rhythm game based around a high school orchestra, with the player assuming the role of a violinist named Therese. It features a hybrid keyboard-and-mouse control scheme to emulate the two-handed nature of playing a violin. <i>Reignite</i> was born out of a desire to create a rhythm game with classical music, tell a character-driven story, and feature an instrument not yet used in a rhythm game. <i>Reignite</i> was my focus in college, and is currently on indefinite hiatus.</p>
